Donald's Blog



Hi, my name is donald. I used to be in business, but now I have a very important job. I make decsions for the United States of America! 

My favorite thing to eat is a well-done steak, Ketchup Please! 

I do not like Democrats. They bully me and tell me my hands are small, but to be honest, my hands are huge. I mean believe me, HUGE.
